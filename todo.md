> not in priority order  
  
- feat: add pagination (not render all the book in one chrome page.)
- feat: adding more style to the page.
- ~~fix: render images in the right spot~~
- ~~feat: be able to open the book and images without storing them locally~~
- ~~feat: make a starting page where you can choose between different books in your collection, not just one book.~~
- ~~feat: linked to the previuos feat, permit to choose the book filename, not only `book.epub`. Partially done.~~
